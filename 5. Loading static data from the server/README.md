In order to understand how Socket.IO pushes data to the client, we will create an application that emits a static object. Although this exercise may seem contrived(hard to belief), the only difference between static data and dynamic data is that static data only needs to be emitted once, whereas dynamic data needs to be emitted on each mutation. The client side doesn't concern itself with the frequency of state changes, so the difference between emitting data once and emitting data frequently is inconsequential. If we can rerender the state of a dashboard once, we can rerender it a million times.
